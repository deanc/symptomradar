# Symptomradar (Oiretutka) crowdsources coronavirus symptoms from news media audience

Symptomradar (Oiretutka in Finnish) is a service by software company Futurice and newspaper Helsingin Sanomat to crowdsource coronavirus symptoms from general public.

Crowdsourcing happens by asking questions in an embed that is placed on news media pages. The responses are stored without personally identifiable information. Results are shown in embeds and separate Oiretutka.fi or Symptomradar.com page.

The project is open source with MIT license. We encourage media outlets to collaborate within countries to create a service to map the spread of the virus. We welcome all contributors to the project.

# How to deploy
